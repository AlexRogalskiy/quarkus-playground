= Quarkus with Neo4j

How to use Neo4J OGM with Quarkus.


== To try

Requires Docker, Maven, JDK 14, and `cypher-shell` (or alternatively run the Cypher-Queries in your IDE or the http://localhost:7474/browser/[Neo4J Browser^]).

You can start a fresh Neo4J instance with:

[source,bash]
----
./run-graph-db.sh
----

If you want to try out the _undo_ feature, as shown https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/undo-with-neo4j[here^], you need to start Neo4J https://github.com/sdaschner/neo4j-persistent-action-listener/blob/4.0/build-run-test-db.sh[in this way^].


In another terminal, run the following to create the sample data:

[source,bash]
----
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p test --file deployment/migration/cyphers/V001__SchemaMasterData.cypher
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p test --file deployment/migration/cyphers/V002__AddFlavorName.cypher
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p test --file deployment/migration/cyphers/V003__RemoveFlavorDescription.cypher
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p test --file deployment/migration/cyphers/V004__Schema.cypher
----

Then build and run the application:

[source,bash]
----
mvn package
java -jar target/quarkus-playground-runner.jar 
----

Or you run the development mode with:

[source,bash]
----
mvn quarkus:dev
----

Then query the coffee beans with (with or without `jq`):

[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/beans/ | jq .
curl "localhost:8080/beans?flavor=fruit" | jq .
curl localhost:8080/beans/special | jq .
----


== Run in Kubernetes

In order to run the example and Neo4J in Kubernetes, check out the following videos:
